# Inferra

**Inferra** is an open-source platform for hosting, sharing, and running pre-trained Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and NLP models. It provides a simple UI to explore models, make predictions, and deploy them easily, making model inference accessible for both your team and the wider community.

We are a group of students and researchers from the **Faculty of Engineering, Cairo University**, working to make AI models easy to use, share, and deploy.

## Why Inferra?
- **Central Model Hub** – Keep all your models in one place for easy access and management.
- **Easy Inference** – Run predictions directly from the UI with minimal setup.
- **Deployment Ready** – Designed to simplify deploying models for use by anyone.
- **Framework Agnostic** – Works with models from any framework.

## Our Vision
To create a platform where models can be easily hosted, explored, and used — empowering researchers, developers, and enthusiasts to leverage AI without the overhead of setup or integration.
